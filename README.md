# This is a repository for all my discord bot projects. (Made in discord.py)
The main reason for this code is for examples and allowing others to re-use my code.

See something you made? provide proof and I'll be sure to credit you.

## Full discord bot projects

### Holiday calendar bot.
Terrible, hardcoded mess in my own opinion, however, I did it so you don't have to. Daily announcements.

### Twitch Notifications Bot.
A more useful bot I've created. If you use the code from there as is, I do believe it should work as long as you pip install all the required packages, and put the proper information into the config. It will then allow you to get updates from when a twitch streamer goes live.

(you will need to provide your own twitch api keys)

### Mc Status Bot
a minecraft server status bot, that gets a minecraft server's status and relevant information.

### RoleMenu bot
a discord bot that uses dislash.py to include a discord.py rolemenu bot using the selectmenu message component.

## Addons/Cogs
These are cogs I've created to be a little more plug and play with the discord bots I've created. 

### tempchans
Tempchans is a cog I made to provide more teamspeak esque temporary voice channels for users to split off into whenever server voice channels get too crazy.
I use this in a discord server I host and it's become a staple and a must have, as many different groups of people talk in there, and making admins is a hastle.

This cog is mostly example code as well as a plug and play cog. 

# FAQ

## Why configuration.py?
I Use a config.py file to put relevant info into because it is easy to import in python, setting a variable to a basic string, and then importing it into the main file. (I am unsure wether or not it's bad to do this, but it is rather hard-codey)
