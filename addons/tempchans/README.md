# Tempchans
temp chans is a discord bot cog aimed towards letting users make temporary voice channels to fit a need, when there are no channels available.

### SETUP
make sure the main bot file has ample code to direct to this cog.
Next, setup the following file path. 
 - (path of main bot file)/cogs/configs/tempchannels.json 

Then start and stop the bot and fill in necessary information into the config.


## NOTE
This cog was made public under the pretense of providing example code to go off of. By no means is it perfect.
See the readme in the root repository folder for more details.

## Features

- channels can be created with a command (while the user is in a voice channel)
- channels are deleted once everyone in the temporary channel leaves.
- channels can be edited by the person who made them, or the next in line person.
- channels can be given custom names, be locked, and have a user cap.
